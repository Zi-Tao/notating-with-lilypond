# Notating Music with LilyPond

In this repository, we'll learn a few ways to notate music using LilyPond.

LilyPond is a free and open-source music notation system. With LilyPond, you can write your score in a plain text file. LilyPond can turn this plain text file into an engraved PDF file, PostScript file, or MIDI -- Musical Instrument Digital Interface -- file.

- You can learn more about LilyPond at <http://lilypond.org/>
- For a more thorough introduction, look at the [Learning Manual](http://lilypond.org/doc/v2.18/Documentation/learning/index.html).
